        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Hi, I’m <strong>Jacqueline Sapon Rodriguez</strong>, a 17-year-old Hispanic student with a passion for <strong>computer science and technology</strong>.
        </p>

        <section class="project-detail">
            <p>
                Originally, I dreamed of becoming an architect, but after attending a summer program at Rice University, I discovered that <strong>computer science is where my curiosity and creativity truly align</strong>. Since then, I have been actively exploring coding, robotics, and technology to build solutions that can help others.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have taken <strong>AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A</strong>, and I am proud to be <strong>Java certified and Fusion 360 certified</strong>. I also participated in <strong>NASA’s 6-Month High School Aerospace Scholars Program</strong>, where I deepened my interest in engineering and space technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further explore my interests, I attended the <strong>UT Computer Science for Women Program</strong>, as well as the <strong>Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program and One-Month Self-Paced Program</strong>. During my freshman year, I began strengthening my skills by enrolling in online summer coding camps, including <strong>Creative Coding with JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Java Basics</strong>, which laid the foundation for my programming journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to <strong>create tools, projects, and resources that make people’s lives easier while inspiring other young women, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, to explore the world of technology</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I enjoy helping my siblings with their studies, learning new design tools, and working on personal projects that blend technology and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me. Feel free to check out my <a href="portfolio.html">projects</a> and <a href="Certificates.html">certifications</a>, and reach out if you would like to connect!
